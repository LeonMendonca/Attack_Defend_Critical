# Attack_Defend_Critical
An interactive 1v1 CLI based game, written in Shell :D

HOW TO RUN? navigate to the folder where you've cloned the project, and then bash adc.sh OR ./adc.sh

NOTE:ONCE YOU RUN THE PROGRAM, THE TERMINAL IS CLEARED AFTER 5 SECONDS
IVE JUST INCLUDED THIS BECAUSE THE TERMINAL GETS CLUTTERED WHILE RUNNING THE PROGRAM

INPUTS
1 - Attack:Inflict damage to your opponent 
2 - Defend:Defend yourself by increasing your HP
3 - Critical:Inflict severe damage to your opponent, but at a certain HP cost (like a heavy toll, lol)

NOTE:All of them generate random number within a specific range
Attack - 5 to 10
Defend - 5 to 15
Critical - HP Cost - 10 to 20 and Damamge Dealt - 15 to 30

No. of moves : infinite - Attack, 3 - Defense, 2 - Critical

THE PROGRAM ITSELF PROVIDES ENOUGH DETAILS, SO YOU MAY FIGURE IT OUT WHILE PLAYING

THANKS FOR READING! :)
